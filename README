kindlesync
==========
kindlesync is a set of programs to handle file syncing between
a personal computer and a kindle. It achieves this over HTTP.
P2P sharing through mDNS is planned, assuming the network stack
supports the technology.

Largely, kindlesync works like a package manager - the client 
synchronizes a local database, using it to download files from
a server. The front-end is built as KUAL extension, which uses
a helper script to execute commands.

Feature tracker (items will be removed as they are implemented):
[] File integrity checks
[] P2P sharing over mDNS discovery
    [] Dynamic KUAL menu generation
